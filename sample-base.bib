%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

	abstract = {Modelling is an under-used tool in the NHS operationally; this is primarily due to a lack of familiarity, but also due to the complex nature of the healthcare system, lack of sufficiently detailed data, and difficulties trying to distil the heterogeneity of individual patient experience into manageable groups.  This paper describes a model of patient flow and resource use on the critical care unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary, -produced using a novel technique which helps avoid these issues by using genuine routinely collected historical data in lieu of trying to model individual patients. This has had -unexpected benefits in terms of engagement with the model as it is much easier to justify its validity when it is based directly on real people.  Going forward, we will use this approach to model an entire hospital.},

@article{bart16n,
	Abstract = {Abstract The use of surrogate models is a standard method for dealing with complex real-world optimization problems. The first surrogate models were applied to continuous optimization problems. In recent years, surrogate models gained importance for discrete optimization problems. This article takes this development into consideration. The first part presents a survey of model-based methods, focusing on continuous optimization. It introduces a taxonomy, which is useful as a guideline for selecting adequate model-based optimization tools. The second part examines discrete optimization problems. Here, six strategies for dealing with discrete data structures are introduced. A new approach for combining surrogate information via stacking is proposed in the third part. The implementation of this approach will be available in the open source R package SPOT2. The article concludes with a discussion of recent developments and challenges in continuous and discrete application domains. },

abstract = "Extraction–transformation–loading (ETL) tools are pieces of software responsible for the extraction of data from several sources, its cleansing, customization, reformatting, integration, and insertion into a data warehouse. Building the ETL process is potentially one of the biggest tasks of building a warehouse; it is complex, time consuming, and consumes most of data warehouse project’s implementation efforts, costs, and resources. Building a data warehouse requires focusing closely on understanding three main areas: the source area, the destination area, and the mapping area (ETL processes). The source area has standard models such as entity relationship diagram, and the destination area has standard models such as star schema, but the mapping area has not a standard model till now. In spite of the importance of ETL processes, little research has been done in this area due to its complexity. There is a clear lack of a standard model that can be used to represent the ETL scenarios. In this paper we will try to navigate through the efforts done to conceptualize the ETL processes. Research in the field of modeling ETL processes can be categorized into three main approaches: Modeling based on mapping expressions and guidelines, modeling based on conceptual constructs, and modeling based on UML environment. These projects try to represent the main mapping activities at the conceptual level. Due to the variation and differences between the proposed solutions for the conceptual design of ETL processes and due to their limitations, this paper also will propose a model for conceptual design of ETL processes. The proposed model is built upon the enhancement of the models in the previous models to support some missing mapping features."
